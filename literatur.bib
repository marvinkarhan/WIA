  abstract     = {Dark patterns are user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended and potentially harmful decisions. We present automated techniques that enable experts to identify dark patterns on a large set of websites. Using these techniques, we study shopping websites, which often use dark patterns to influence users into making more purchases or disclosing more information than they would otherwise. Analyzing ~53K product pages from ~11K shopping websites, we discover 1,818 dark pattern instances, together representing 15 types and 7 broader categories. We examine these dark patterns for deceptive practices, and find 183 websites that engage in such practices. We also uncover 22 third-party entities that offer dark patterns as a turnkey solution. Finally, we develop a taxonomy of dark pattern characteristics that describes the underlying influence of the dark patterns and their potential harm on user decision-making. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for stakeholders including researchers and regulators to study, mitigate, and minimize the use of these patterns.},

In this work, we analyze Dark Patterns in 240 popular mobile apps and conduct an online experiment with 589 users on how they perceive Dark Patterns in such apps. The results of the analysis show that 95\% of the analyzed apps contain one or more forms of Dark Patterns and, on average, popular applications include at least seven different types of deceiving interfaces. The online experiment shows that most users do not recognize Dark Patterns, but can perform better in recognizing malicious designs if informed on the issue. We discuss the impact of our work and what measures could be applied to alleviate the issue.},

We have manually analyzed 300 data collection consent notices from news outlets that are built to ensure compliance with GDPR. The analysis uncovered a variety of strategies or dark patterns that circumvent the intent of GDPR by design. We further study the presence and variety of these dark patterns in these “cookie consents” and use our observations to specify the concept of dark pattern in the context of consent elicitation.},

  abstract  = {A dark pattern is a user interface that purposefully deceives users for the benefit of the business by influencing their decision making process. The objectives of this research paper are three-fold. The first objective is to determine the difference in the susceptibility of the users to the different types of dark patterns. The second is to identify the underlying factors that make users victims of the different types of dark patterns. The third objective is to identify the difference in the impact on the users, caused by the least identified and the most identified dark pattern. This paper presents five elements that play an important role in the identification of dark patterns by the users, even if they are not completely aware of the unethical intentions behind the design. In addition to that, a taxonomy is formed with the factors that trigger the users towards dark patterns. Strong correlations and associations between these five elements and the user's ability to identify dark patterns are found. It was also found that the correlations between the elements differ from the type of dark pattern in consideration. This paper helps in understanding the factors that influence the users to become victims of dark patterns and the difference in the impact of the different types of dark patterns on the user. The variables and factors of identification determined in this research can benefit the HCI community to understand the adverse effects of dark patterns on usability.},

Temporal dark patterns pose particular danger to users as their power is already well known by developers, and they've been honed to a high degree of effectiveness. Don't confuse irresistibility, where the user wants to come back and spend more time in the application, with temporal dark patterns, where the user feels obliged to come back and spend more time in the application. When the user is in the application, irresistible apps make the time feel well spent and that something meaningful has happened, while apps that use temporal dark patterns make the time feel wasted and pointless.},

The effects of frames on preferences are compared to the effects of perspectives on perceptual appearance.

However, little work has addressed ethical considerations as they emerge in everyday conversations about ethics in venues such as social media. In this late breaking work, we describe online conversations about a concept known as "asshole design" on Reddit, and the relationship of this concept to another practitioner-focused concept known as "dark patterns." We analyzed 1002 posts from the subreddit '/r/assholedesign' to identify the types of artifact being shared and the interaction purposes that were perceived to be manipulative or unethical as a type of "asshole design." We identified a subset of these posts relating to dark patterns, quantifying their occurrences using an existing dark patterns typology.},

  abstract  = {New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to conform with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its requirements for consent when companies collect and process users' personal data. This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8\% meet our minimal requirements based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22-23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page decreases consent by 8-20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an effective way to increase compliance.},
